This dynamic app's functionalities include:
  1. Playback control: you can play or pause a song as needed. 
  2. Play the previous or next song: easily navigate through your playlist by playing the previous or next song.
  3. Shuffle mode: enjoy your music in a fresh and randomized order.
  4. Repeat song: For those tracks you can't get enough of, the app provides an option to repeat a song as many times as you please.
